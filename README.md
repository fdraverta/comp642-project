## Instructions to run cloner notebook
Download notebook locally, upload to colab and run all cells. This notebook is simply an initiator to get the repo into your drive, its not part of the project.
While cloning, replace username with your username and authkey with your authkey. 

## Data extraction
After running the cloner notebook, run the data extraction notebook to permanently extract the data files into your google drive. Same as cloner, run it separately from the project as it is another initator script
